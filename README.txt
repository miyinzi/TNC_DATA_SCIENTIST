# Data Analysis Task

## Background
The Agricultural Survey of African Farm householdâ€™s dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides insights into the characteristics of over 9,500 households across eleven African countries. The dataset captures details about household members, including gender, age, marital status, education, involvement in farm & non-farm activities, farm entity type, household size, and geographic information.

## Purpose of this repository
In this repository, I conduct data analysis to answer specific questions using the dataset mentioned above.

## Instructions
### Data Loading & Inspection
- I load the data using R. 

### Descriptive Statistics
- I compute descriptive statistics for gender, marital status, age of the household head, education background, household size).

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
- I identify inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers in the dataset. I use boxplot to identify potential outliers. 

### Probability & Mathematical Modelling
- I compute probability of a household having at least one member engaged in both farm and non-farm activities.
- I use mathematical modelling to estimate the expected number of households meeting this criterion in a sample of 100 randomly selected households.

### Data Visualization
- I create a bar chart to visualize categories of marital status of the household head.

## Instructions for Navigating the Directory
- The main analysis files are located in the root directory.
- The `Chris Mwungu' file is the code that I use to conduct the assigmnet.
- The `data` file is the raw data that I use for analysis.

## How to Run the Code
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Run the script labelled as `Chris Mwungu'
