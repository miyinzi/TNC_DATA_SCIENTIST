# Agricultural Survey of African Farm Households

## Introduction
The Agricultural Survey of African Farm householdâ€™s dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides insights into the characteristics of over 9,500 households across eleven African countries. The dataset captures details about household members, including gender, age, marital status, education, involvement in farm & non-farm activities, farm entity type, household size, and geographic information.

## Project Overview
In this repository, I conduct data analysis to answer specific questions using the dataset mentioned above.

## Instructions
### Data Loading & Inspection
- Load the provided dataset into your preferred statistical programming language (Python or R) using the appropriate libraries (e.g., Pandas or dplyr).

### Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate and present descriptive statistics for key variables present in the dataset (e.g., gender, marital status, education background, household size).

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Identify and handle any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers in the dataset using data manipulation tools.

### Probability & Mathematical Modelling
- Calculate the probability of a household having at least one member engaged in both farm and non-farm activities.
- Use mathematical modelling to estimate the expected number of households meeting this criterion in a sample of 100 randomly selected households.

### Data Visualization
- Create clear and visually appealing visualizations for key variables.
- Present a visual representation of the frequency distribution of marital status categories.
